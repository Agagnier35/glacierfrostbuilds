# [Glacier Frost 2 Builds](https://glacierfrost2builds.herokuapp.com/)

Introducing LavaFlame2's biggest enemy: GlacierFrost2

Create and share your builds for the game [Legends of Idleon](https://www.legendsofidleon.com). The goal of this tool is
to have one place to share user-generated builds.

I made this tool because we had an excel sheet, which got deprecated for the idleoncompanion
Then ideloncommpanion hasn't updated been in a while, making the builds deprecated

The ultimate goal would be to have a tool, with minimal maintenance by the developers. In the best case scenario, the
only thing we need to update is new assets/classes/talents/bump game version, but the rest would be managed by the users

## Features

* Create Talents builds for your characters
* Search builds for your class, and use the advanced search to find specific builds to accomplish your goal
* Upvote/Downvote builds, to help other users find the most relevant builds
* You can connect safely and securely with your Discord account, using their OAUTH2 protocol! 

## Technology stack

* Kotlin JDK11
* React-Typescript
* PostgressSQL
* Heroku, TravisCI

## Building the Project

> `./gradlew clean build` in the root of the project
